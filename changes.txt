1. Throw exceptions as opposed to returning false in readWord and deleteWord methods
2. Proper spacing [ if(! empty($var)) {} ].
3. Proper naming of files and classes (Begin with Capital letters)
4. .gitignore composer.lock for dev flexibility
5. Extend classes without a trailing slash. Instead, access it with the use keyword.
6. Move exceptions into exceptions folder.


TO DO
1. setUp/ tearDown methods for tests
2. Comprehensive readme.md
3. sample package usage


FUTURE
1. Coveralls
2. More detailed rather than single generic Exceptions.
